# Discord Bot


## Overview
This project houses a variety of commands for a custom discord bot my friend and I set up on our personal server. Our reason for creating this was mainly for fun, but it also allowed us to gain experience with APIs, JSON and running a program on a server.  


## My Contributions - Sam Bernau
My primary contributions to this project include the listed items below; however, I helped in part with the rest. 

- redditAPI and associated code
- Database setup
- botTimer (ables us to set the bot to an inactive state when commands are not being used)
- DiscordAPI setup
- JSON parser (parse data from reddit results)
